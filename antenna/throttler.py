    The throttler can throttle incoming crashes using the content of the crash.
    To throttle, you set up a rule set which is a list of ``Rule`` instances.
    That goes in a Python module which is loaded at run time.

    If you don't want to throttle anything, use this::

        BREAKPAD_THROTTLER_RULES=antenna.throttler.ACCEPT_ALL

    If you want to support all products, use this::

        BREAKPAD_THROTTLER_PRODUCTS=antenna.throttler.ALL_PRODUCTS

    To set up a rule set, put it in a Python file and define the rule set
    there. For example, you could have file ``myruleset.py`` with this in it::

        from antenna.throttler import Rule

        rules = [
            Rule('ProductName', 'Firefox', 100),
            # ...
        ]

    then set ``BREAKPAD_THROTTLER_RULES`` to the path for that. For example,
    depending on the current working directory and ``PYTHONPATH``, the above could be::

        BREAKPAD_THROTTLER_RULES=myruleset.rules
